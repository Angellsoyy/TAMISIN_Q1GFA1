    <div style ="background-color: rgb(255, 248, 220);"> <p>Haiiii, I am Angelique Nadeen Tamisin. I am still 13 years old, soon to be 14 by november 5. 
        I enjoy writing poems, essays and songs for it’s my way of expressing my feelings through words. 
        I also enjoy singing, dancing and acting. I love ice skating and practicing archery for fun. 
        I find it comforting when it comes to doing all of those. My favorite subjects are mathematics, 
        english and science. My weakest subject would be computer science. My number 1 go-to safe place would 
        be my sisters. They are the first people that I would always go to when I’m feeling drained or when I 
        have good news. I will always be grateful that I have them in my life.</p>
